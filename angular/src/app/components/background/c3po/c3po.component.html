      <h5>Overview</h5>
      <p>
        The Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Project on Outcomes (C3PO) is an ongoing, multi-center registry that
        began prospectively collecting data from 8 participating centers in 2007.  The goals of the C3PO collaborative
        group included the development of methods to assess and compare outcomes, while exploring measures of procedural
        efficacy.  Utilizing an investigative dataset, collected in the registry between 2007 and 2010, the C3PO project
        yielded baseline rates for adverse events, defined procedure type risk categories, and identified indicators of
        hemodynamic vulnerability.  This data was then used to develop a risk adjustment model, now known as
        CHARM (Congenital Heart Adjustment for Risk Method), which made the equitable comparison of adverse
        event rates among institutions possible.  This metric received full endorsement from the National Quality
        Forum (NQF) in 2012 as a pediatric quality measure.
      </p>
      <h5>C3PO Data Collection and Reporting</h5>
      <p>
        A web-based application for data entry was created specifically for the C3PO project using Microsoft Visual Studio NET tools.
        All data entry was securely protected by SSL encryption and role-based security parameters were built-in to prevent unauthorized access to data.
        Data entry occurred at the time of the catheterization procedure and was completed by the physician performing the procedure or a designee.
        Patient and procedural variables as well as the occurrence of adverse events were recorded on all cases performed at the institution.

      </p>
      <p>
        To validate the data entered, the sponsor provided monthly exception reports to highlight missing data fields or data that was out of range requiring validation.
        Additionally, the sponsor provided all participating sites a list of all cases that were entered in to the database to verify against their institutional records.
        To prevent coding variations, all adverse events (AEs) were reviewed by the principal investigator and a designee for proper definition of the seriousness and preventability of the episode.
        After 15 months of data collection, an independent audit was conducted at each site by the sponsor.
        A random sample of 10% of the sites cases were reviewed for accuracy and completeness by comparing information entered in to the database to information in the medical records.

      </p>
      <h5> C3PO Development of Outcome Assessment Tools</h5>
      <b>Procedure-Type Risk Categories</b>
      <p>
        A prior single center retrospective study categorized procedure types by anticipated similar risk of AE occurrence, according to expert opinion, utilizing consensus methodology.Although this worked well, the C3PO group worked to further define the procedure-type risk categories by employing both
        consensus and empirical methodologies to the investigative dataset (2007-2010) to improve the generalizability of the data.  The cases were parsed into the appropriate risk categories (1-6) as defined by Bergersen et. al., and in July 2009 the C3PO group collaborated to further empirically define the categories.  The outcome of the analysis done by the group was the creation of four procedure risk categories.
      </p>
      <b>Hemodynamic Vulnerability</b>
      <p>
        The previous single-center analysis provided a correlation between supposed hemodynamic indicators and the occurrence of adverse events through the use of subjective definitions and not data models.  The C3PO group assessed eight separate hemodynamic variables for inclusion in the final risk method: cardiac index, right ventricular (RV) systolic pressure, RV to systemic pressure ratio, systemic ventricle end-diastolic-pressure, mixed venous saturation, systemic arterial saturation, main pulmonary artery systemic pressure, and main pulmonary artery mean pressure.  Multivariable modeling produced four indicators of hemodynamic vulnerability independently related to the occurrence of high severity AEs: systemic ventricular end-diastolic pressure ≥ 18mmHg, systemic arterial saturation &lt;95% (or &lt; 78% if single ventricle (SV)), mixed venous saturation &lt; 60% (or &lt; 50% if SV), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥ 45mmHg (or mean ≥ 17 if SV).

      </p>
      <h5><b> CHARM</b></h5>
      <p>
        The final CHARM model developed by the C3PO group combined the patient and procedural characteristics that correlated to the occurrence of AEs: procedure-type risk category, number of hemodynamic indicators, and age&lt;1year.  Using the CHARM methodology, institutions can compute the predicted probability of an AE for all cases at their institution.  The sum of all predicted probabilities gives the expected number of AE occurrences, taking in to consideration the case mix within the data set.
        To make a comparison between institutions or physicians at one institution, the standardized adverse event ratio (SAER) must be calculated.  To compute the SAER the observed AE rate (number of level 3/4/5 AEs in the dataset divided by total number of cases) is divided by the expected AE rate (expected number of AE occurrences divided by total number of cases).

    <h5> Efficacy and Outcome Assessment</h5>
    <p>
      In addition to the creation of the CHARM method, the C3PO investigative dataset also yielded measures of procedural efficacy in population subsets.  PA rehabilitation was found to be associated with a 10% incidence of high-level severity AE.  Hemodynamic vulnerability, young age, use of cutting balloons, and lower operator experience were significant independent risk factors for procedure-related AE.  Hybrid procedures were among the interventions investigated and were found to have a low incidence of major AE occurrence.  Procedural success is common and AEs, especially higher severity AEs, are rare for balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in patients with isolated pulmonary valve stenosis.  Cardiac catheterizations involving endomyocardial biopsies can be performed in pediatric heart transplant recipients with a low AE rate and high diagnostic yield.
    </p>
    <b> Future Directions</b>
      <p>
        The next phase for C3PO is to move beyond definition toward quality improvement (QI) initiatives aimed at improving the outcomes for all patients undergoing catheterization with congenital heart disease.  The group will be expanding participation to include 15 sites and will begin prospectively collecting data in May of 2013.   For this new venture, the previously established web based tool has been redesigned utilizing Siverlight technology and features improved speed, functionality, and updated nomenclature.  Institutional data will be available in comparison to other participating C3PO-QI sites in aggregate including procedure counts, limited patient and procedural characteristics, and outcomes such as highest severity adverse events and transfusion rates.  Quality reports will include outcome metrics such as risk adjusted adverse event ratios using CHARM.  A time series analysis will allow sites to track performance over time by physician and institution in comparison to other sites in aggregate.  To portray data in a fashion that is quickly responsive to system improvements, control charts will be created, and for uncommon adverse events, time and/or number of cases between specific adverse events will be reported.
        <br />
        <br />
        The initial goal of the new C3PO-QI collaboration is to reduce radiation exposure in pediatric cardiac catheterization interventions.  To work towards this reduction, established QI scientific methodology will be utilized.  Initially, a key driver diagram, a common QI design tool which summarizes the key factors thought to have a potential impact on our goal, and strategies or changes for improvement will be created.  Subsequently, PDSA methodology will be employed, which involves 1) proposing changes based on hunches and theories (Plan), 2) implementing the change (Do), 3) measuring or describing the effect (Study), and 4) reviewing and upgrading the process based on what is learned (Act).
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition to radiation reduction, the C3PO-QI group will also look at efficacy outcomes for six specific lesion types: Pulmonary Stenosis, Aortic Stenosis, Coarctation of the Aorta, Atrial Septal Defect, Patent Ductus Arteriosus, and Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Placement.
